                    The University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP) has been handling student
                    organization processes through the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) for the past few years. Just
                    recently, in March 2020, all transactions for students have been slowly converted
                    through online means, which poses a huge gap in terms of communication between the
                    OSA and the recognized student organizations.<br><br> Although emails and
                    contact information have been opened to the public for transactions, students are
                    still facing delays and backlogs in their activities which include approval of
                    documents, email responses, and the like. With these ongoing situations, the lack of
                    a centralized platform to organize the transactions and create a much responsive
                    communication are left unaddressed.

                    In able to address the current problems and challenges in communication between the Office of
                    Student Affairs (OSA) and the recognized student organizations in the university, the Federation of
                    Accredited Extracurricular Student Organizations (FAESO) will be developing MagkahiOSA: A
                    Centralized Platform.<br><br>
                    Together with its partner organizations, it aims to develop a platform where all transactions online
                    will be conducted for easy access; in line with the paperless' advocacy of the university. This
                    project will be introduced to the students of USTP prior to the end of the Academic Year 2021-2022
                    with high hopes in addressing the problem.
